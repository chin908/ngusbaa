                   <h1>A thank you.</h1>
                   <section>
                   <p><i>First and foremost, I want to say thank you. I know, I said this for how many times already nd you are used to it, but Angeline, I won't get tired saying these things to you. After we broke up, things made me want to say thanks even more.</p></i>
                   <section>
                   <p><i>To be honest, that break up didn't just help me, it saved me, it saved "us". If that didn't happen, we will both sink;You'll suffer and I'll be stuck being miserable. It made me realized things. I am somehow thankful bcs you had the courage to do it, but very masakit:( I understand now, I understand why you had to do that. Bangus, it didn't make me love you any less;rather, it made me love and admire you even more. Yes, Angeline, even from afar.</p></i>
                    <section>
                    <p><i>I am thankful. even though we just had a little time to be with each other again, I enjoyed your company. Your presence brought me peace and it kept me sane. You put me away from the things that have been affecting me, even if it means you had to hold every torn that I have to save me. even if it means you, being hurt by someone you want to be save. I'm sorry:( If it weren't for you, I wouldn't realize that I can get rid of every toxic traits that I have. I wouldn't be entering 2025 with forgiveness for myself and with light mind and heart. You helped me see  the version of me that I didn't know that existing. I am greatful sa'yo, bangus. You are too good and gentle. I hope 2025 will be good sa'yo.</p></i>
