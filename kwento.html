                   <p>Hey, I know you know:c bae, after our last walk together, I did nothing everyday but to reminisce every little things that we had. I know you know how much I miss you nyahah, you always seems mad?!:/ Alam mo ba, kausapin mo lang ako sa IG notes, kinikilig na ako non. Tapos when you directed message me, Idk how to feel, am I going to feel kilig or am I going to be afraid. Ikaw kasi eh, I miss you saur much. sensya ka na tropa, di ko na kaya. I want to know if kumusta ka? I mean alam ko naman na okay or what but I want to known kung how are you sa ibang aspects. How are you physically, mentally, or basta something like that HWSHA antok na  kasi ako teh, hindi ko na kaya lagyan ng chat box to para makapag reply ka but okay lang yan. Nung ng end tayo nang literal, so much realization bruh, Alot of things have been bothering me, kahit up until know, but guess what hfhssdbh I know na how to deal with those:P hihi miss na kita, bounce back bye po.</p>
