                   <p><i>Bangus, I made this site for you bcs I want to. Nothing more. You shouldn't be afraid to say the truth just because you'll feel guilty na I made you this but your decision doesn't align with what I want na answer ha. I did this web since new year naman and as I said I want to make something for you.^^</p></i>

                   <p><i>I actually don't know how to open this paragraph, nyaha. But these past few days, to be specific, the day after you talked to me about the "ayoko mamisunderstood" thingy until now, that's where this started. Kasabay ng pagiging okay ko as days go by, is the thought of "What if I ask her again?". Angeline, for the last time, do you think there is really no chance for us to be each other's again? An answer to that. I won't rush you; I am willing to wait if you'll tell me that there is still a chance. Please don't push me away after mo i-read 'to:C When we talked, you were resisting yourself; are you afraid to be close sa'kin? Are you afraid to be hurt again? I'm sorry for giving you that love.:'(</p></i>
                   <section>
                   <p><i>Honestly, to be straight forward, that was not really my question, but knowing that there is or there's no chance, will be enough. I was about to ask you if can we make it again? Can we be each other's again? I know you are afraid to get hurt; can you remove that fear and let yourself to trust me again?:C If you will give me a chance, I don't want us to be romantically agad, I want us to be in a talking stage. I want to gain your trust again, I want and I am willing to work for it. That was the only way I know to lessen the worry that you have na baka you'll get hurt nanaman while I am proving myself to you. If you are afraid of how will your friends react once you let me, I understand you. But you don't have to show me off until you are willing to accept the love that I can offer you. This time I promise you I'll do you better. You maybe won't be able to be loved by others, but I assure you that you'll be loved by another version of me. The realization that our breakup got me into made me want na bumalik at bumalik sa'yo. I might look stupid and desperate for asking you nang paulit-ulit about us kahit alam ko na yung sagot, but am nanghihinayang kasi haha.</p></i>

                   <p><i>Whatever your decision is, I will gladly accept it^~^ At least I tried, right? Thats what matters nyaha. Bae, sorry for ruining your new year, but this is the only way that I know to confess this sa'yo. I'm sorry! Hingi handa.</p></i>
